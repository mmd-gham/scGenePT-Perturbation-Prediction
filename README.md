# scGenePT-Perturbation-Prediction
This repository demonstrates how to use trained **scGenePT models** for **perturbation prediction** on the **Norman dataset [1]**, including examples for **single-gene** (e.g., *POU3F2*, *CDKN1B*) and **gene-pair** (*SAMD1+ZBTB1*) perturbations. Multi-gene predictions have **not been evaluated**.
